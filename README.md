# The Lake Debate

Analysis for [Who has more lakes: Minnesota or Wisconsin?](https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/may/23/sara-meaney/who-has-more-lakes-minnesota-or-wisconsin/), a fact check on whether Wisconsin has more lakes than Minnesota (sadly, we don't).

The analysis is done in a `Makefile`. The lake counts from this analysis line up closely with USGS's. For the article, we used USGS's lake counts instead of our own.
